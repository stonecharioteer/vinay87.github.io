        <h1>Vinay Keerthi</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my home page. I am a writer and a coder who works for GKN Aerospace and GKN Driveline. I
        enjoy reading widely, especially books on history, science, politics, mythology and war. I also read Speculative
        Fiction and Fantasy.</p>
        <p>During my free time, I try to learn all I can. You could say I have a Faustian hunger for knowledge that schooling
        in India almost certainly doesn't deserve any credit for. I dabble in tech, math and history. I am currently working on
        trying to find ways to bring intelligence into manufacturing and into our homes in a non buzzword way.</p>

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>I love <b>Sun Tzu</b>'s work, and the works of Marcus Aurelius. Here are some quotes I'd like to share.
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Conform to the enemy's tactics until a favorable opportunity offers; then 
                come forth and engage in a battle that shall prove decisive.</em></p>
            <p><b>Sun Tzu</b></p>
        </blockquote>
