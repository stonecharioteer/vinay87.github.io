Vial: Flask for MicroPython
****************************

In May 2018, my friend Najeem Muhammed began work on a small webserver for the NodeMCU. We weren't very happy with the inbuilt sockets system, mostly because it didn't seem as beautiful as Flask. So I set about forking his code to create a project called Vial, a tiny Flask clone.

Vial hopes to be as easy to use as Flask.
