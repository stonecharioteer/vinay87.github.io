Shelfie, or How to Find a Book When You Own 900+
*************************************************

I own a **lot** of books. I'm not kidding. I have simple needs really, and my money goals are simply to be able to buy one book a day for the rest of my life. I don't buy that many books yet, mostly because I do not have the space to store so many, but I have a kickass bookshelf that my architect sister designed for me. It's like a miasma of all my childhood requirements, and quite simply, keeps the child in me alive.

I own upwards of 900 books. I realize that having a ballpark figure when counting books is foolhardy, so I am working on a project that will help me organize my books easily. It's not that I don't enjoy manually writing down what books I own, but then what sort of programmer doesn't apply programming to every task he is given?

So I came up with Shelfie. Shelfie has had several names in the past, to be honest. I wanted to make something like hassio with voice control, but I settled on this far simpler project because it helped solve an immediate problem. What books do I own, and where are they?
