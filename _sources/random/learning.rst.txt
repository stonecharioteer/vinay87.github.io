Learning
*********

I am constantly learning new things. This stems because I am super curious. It's all I can do to control this,
and focus. I like my bullet journal for this reason. But sometimes, it helps to be super curious.
If my school teachers understood this instead of wondering why I was a bad student,
I would have spent school years learning so much more.

At this point, these are the things I am learning. These are things I want to learn, and I'll use 5 ðŸŸŠs to mark progress.

.. admonition:: Note
    :class: tip

    I consider things **learnt** when I make something with it. Something useful. I'll then make an entry in the projects pages.
