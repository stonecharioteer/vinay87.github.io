                <p>Welcome to my home page. I am a writer and a coder who works for GKN Aerospace and GKN Driveline. I
                enjoy reading widely, especially books on history, science, politics, mythology and war. I also read Speculative
                Fiction and Fantasy.</p>
                <p>During my free time, I try to learn all I can. You could say I have a Faustian hunger for knowledge that schooling
                in India almost certainly doesn't deserve any credit for. I dabble in tech, math and history. I am currently working on
                trying to find ways to bring intelligence into manufacturing and into our homes in a non buzzword way.</p>

                <h2>Quotes</h2>
                <p>I love <b>Sun Tzu</b>'s work, and the works of Marcus Aurelius. Here are some quotes I'd like to share.
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Conform to the enemy's tactics until a favorable opportunity offers; then 
                        come forth and engage in a battle that shall prove decisive.</em></p>
                    <p><b>Sun Tzu</b></p>
                </blockquote>
